# dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles. It is organized into the following bash files:
* `.aliases` - Bash aliases.
* `.bash_prompt` - Bash prompt.
* `.exports` - Exported variables.
* `.extra` - Miscellaneous commands to run.
* `.functions` - Bash functions.
* `.path` - Additional directories added to my PATH.

And the following Vim files and directories:

* `.vim` - Vim plugin directory.
* `.vimrc` - Vim configuration.

The script `configure.sh` assumes the above files are in the directory `$HOME/dev/dotfile`
and will create a soft link to them from one's home directory (`$HOME`).

To configure one's `.bash_profile` then only the following needs to be added:

```
for file in ~/.{aliases,bash_prompt,exports,extra,functions,path}; do
    [ -r "$file" ] && [ -f "$file" ] && source "$file";
done;
unset file;
```

## Details

When configuring one's environment one can edit either `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`.
The difference between the two is that `.bash_profile` is executed for login shells
whereas `.bashrc` is executed for interactive non-login shells. So when you login
to a machine, either via a console at the machine or remotely via ssh, then
`.bash_profile` is executed. If you open a new terminal window or start a new bash
shell with `/bin/bash` then `.bashrc` is run.

Macâ€™s Terminal (and iTerm by default though this can be configured) is an exception
to the above rules and runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window,
calling `.bash_profile` instead of `.bashrc.`
